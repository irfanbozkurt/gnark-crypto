// Package Eisenstein provides Eisenstein integer arithmetic.
//
// The Eisenstein integers form a commutative ring of algebraic integers in the
// algebraic number field Q(ω) – the third cyclotomic field.  These are of the
// form z = a + bω, where a and b are integers and ω is a primitive third root
// of unity i.e. ω²+ω+1 = 0.
